Is there any way to run the script using other user account and credential inside part of the script?  (embedding a special user account and password)  Or ask the user to input the special account and password for run the script with?

Yes, sure.  If it is possible to embedding the password.  Can it be encrypted the password in the script or has to comvert to executable to hide it?

you can store it securely but not exactly in the script. I'll mention that too.
