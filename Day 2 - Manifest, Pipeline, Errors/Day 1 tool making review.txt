Tool -- a script or function that does one thing.  

"Controller" Script -- series of statments and commands (including cmdlets, functions [tools]) to achieve a larger task or set of tasks.

Tool - can be (more) easily tested, and can be re-used in multiple (controller) scripts.

Tools and controller scripts are often (usually) planned for distribution or use by others (end-users or technicians). 

--
A "script" is a group of commands, combined with flow-control logic. 

Parameterize the script means identifying the inputs (parameters) that change with execution, and exposing them as parameters.

Turn our script into a function to allow to be called from multiple scripts.

Combine the functions into a Powershell Module for distribution (or "installation" in your own computer).

Process:
   - Modelling or designing or finding "use cases".
      What do you expect this do? Who is the "user".
      What would the user type? What do you expect them to provide (input). 
    - Dividing this into individual tasks that can become tools.

Advantages:
  - Code resuse.... repeatability, consistency, less (human, configuration) errors
  - Allows unit testing
  - Extensible
  - Maintainable
